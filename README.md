 Machine Learning Workshop Project Series


 Introduction
Welcome to my Machine Learning Workshop Project Series GIT repository, where I've documented my comprehensive journey through a triad of intricate machine learning phases. Each phase represents a unique exploration into data science and machine learning, underpinned by a rigorous academic and practical framework. Here, you'll find detailed reports, code snippets, and analytical insights from my foray into feature extraction and classification algorithms.

 Phase A - Feature Extractions on U.S. Drug Overdose Data
In the initial phase, I navigated the complex landscape of feature extraction by applying four distinct tools to a dataset on drug overdose deaths in the United States. This explorative process was meticulously documented, highlighting the versatility and capabilities of each tool. My reflections on the user experience and the suitability of each tool for various data types are captured in a concise report, alongside a bibliographic list detailing the scientific resources consulted during this phase.

Repository Contents:
- Detailed step-by-step overview of the feature extraction process
- Comparative analysis of tool efficacy and user experience
- Bibliographic list of consulted scientific sources

 Phase B - Collaborative Tool Analysis and Comparison
Pairing with a colleague, we exchanged our Phase A projects and delved into each other's tools, applying them to our original datasets. This collaborative effort enriched our understanding of feature extraction tools, leading to a robust personal analysis and a comparative joint report that synthesized our experiences and evaluations of the tools' performance.

Repository Contents:
- Individual analysis reports on new tools
- Joint comparative report of Phase A tools

Phase C - Classification Algorithms on Wine Quality Data
The final phase saw us as part of a four-student group, focusing on a singular database to perform feature extraction and selection before individually venturing into distinct classification algorithms. My task was to process the wine quality database using a carefully chosen and optimally tuned classification algorithm. Rigorous testing with various parameter values and extensive 10-fold cross-validation culminated in a comprehensive report detailing the algorithm's configuration and efficacy.

Repository Contents:
- Report on the chosen classification algorithm, including settings and optimal values
- Group report comparing the results of different algorithms on the wine quality database

 Conclusion
Each phase of this workshop series has been instrumental in advancing my understanding and skills in machine learning. The GIT repository serves not only as a record of my academic journey but also as a platform for collaborative development and peer learning.
