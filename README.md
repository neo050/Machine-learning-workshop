Requirements document for phase one of the project in the machine learning workshop
Features extractions
This phase of the project will be carried out by individuals only.
This phase of the project is designed to give you knowledge about existing tools for performing feature extractions. For this purpose, it is necessary to select an existing database with information in order to experiment with the tools on it. Examples of databases are listed at the end of this document. There is no obligation to choose one of them.


You must choose at least 4 different tools to perform features extraction and features selection and use them on a database of your choice.
You are required to submit a short overview (no more than a page) detailing all the steps you performed with each of the tools on your database.
During the tests, make sure to discover and experiment with the different capabilities of each tool.
In the final report, in addition to detailing all the steps taken, several paragraphs summarizing the ease and comfort of working with each tool as well as comparisons between the different tools - which was more convenient? What less? Which tool is better for one type of data and which for another?
Try to think ahead to your possible future uses of each of the tools and rate which one will be more useful to you and when. Think about what you learned from this experience and describe it.
It is mandatory to attach a bibliographic list to the work (scientific sources from which you obtained the information about the specific tools / setting)!

Please note that you are welcome to use any available, reliable and large enough database to carry out the project. If you found an independent database, you must include the source of the information in the review itself.
Possible sources of information for projects:
• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets - over 100 databases uploaded by surfers (there are several esoteric and interesting topics such as statistics on computer games)
• https://www.data.gov/ - databases uploaded by the US government, there is a lot of information about social issues here
• https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ Huge database of movies and movie ratings.
