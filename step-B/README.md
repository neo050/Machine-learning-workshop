# STEP-B: Collaborative Tool Analysis and Comparison

## Overview
This folder contains the resources and outputs from the second phase of the machine learning workshop project, where I exchanged tools and datasets with a peer to broaden our understanding and application scope.

## Objectives
- To apply and evaluate the effectiveness of new feature extraction tools on a previously used dataset.
- To engage in collaborative analysis, enhancing our comparative understanding of various tools.

## Contents
- `Tool_Application_Code`: Directory with scripts for applying new tools to the dataset.
- `Individual_Reports.pdf`: Contains personal reports detailing experiences with new tools.
- `Joint_Comparative_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report comparing tools from Phase A, incorporating insights gained from this phase.

## Process
- Each participant applied their peer's tools to their original datasets.
- Extensive discussions were held to evaluate the pros and cons of the tools, leading to the creation of detailed reports.

## Conclusion
This phase emphasized the importance of collaboration in data science, providing new perspectives and deeper insights into the toolsets used for feature extraction.
