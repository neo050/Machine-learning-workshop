# STEP-C: Classification Algorithms on Wine Quality Data

## Overview
In the final phase of the machine learning workshop project, this folder documents the application of classification algorithms on the wine quality dataset. Each member of our group focused on different algorithms, fine-tuning them to optimize performance.

## Objectives
- To perform feature extraction and selection on a unified database.
- To apply and fine-tune a specific classification algorithm.
- To conduct extensive testing and validation using cross-validation techniques.

## Contents
- `Classification_Code`: Contains all scripts and notebooks used for the classification tasks.
- `Algorithm_Performance_Report.pdf`: Detailed report discussing the chosen algorithm, parameter tuning, and performance metrics.
- `Group_Comparison_Report.pdf`: A group report that synthesizes the findings from all members, comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms.

## Classification Algorithm
- Detailed experimentation with RandomForest and SVM.
- Optimal settings for RandomForest found to be most effective based on comprehensive metric evaluation.

## Validation
- Implemented 10-fold Stratified K-Fold cross-validation to ensure the reliability and consistency of the model across different data subsets.

## Conclusion
This phase consolidated our learning and provided a platform to practically apply and evaluate complex classification techniques in a collaborative setting.
